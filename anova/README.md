The two datasets contained in this folder were especifically created for teaching purposes for DawnLab @ SMU. R Code was adapted from exercises adapted by Huey Woon Lee (hwlee@smu.edu.sg), originally created by Kevin P. McIntyre (kmcintyr@trinity.edu; https://sites.google.com/view/openstatslab/home).

# anova-between.csv

anova-between.csv is hypothethical data "collected" from 300 participants. In a 2 (sex: male vs. female) x 3 (drink: water vs. tea vs. coffee) between-subjects quasi-experiment, participants were randomly assigned to consume a drink (water, tea, or coffee) and reported their sex (male or female). Self-rated alertness was measured after consuming the drink.

Variables:
  * id (anonymous participant identifier)
  * sex (male or female)
  * condition (drink; water or tea or coffee)
  * alertness (self-reported alertness; continuous from 1.00 to 7.00 where higher values indicate more alertness)
