This folder contains two real datasets.

# ttest-between.csv

ttest-between.csv is taken from real data collected from 385 women in the US (Majeed et al., unpublished manuscript). In a between-subjects experiment, women were randomly assigned to either a gender-math stereotype threat condition or to a control condition. Self-rated task anxiety was measured after the manipulation.

Variables:
  * id (anonymous participant identifier)
  * condition (threat or control)
  * taskAnxiety (task-related anxiety; continuous from 1.00 to 7.00 where higher values indicate more anxiety)

# ttest-within.csv

ttest-within.csv is taken from real data collected from 82 undergraduates in Singapore (Study 1 from [Quek et al., 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7911752/)). In a within-subject experiment, undergraduates underwent both a brief mindfulness breathing experimental condition and mind-wandering control condition in a counterbalanced order across two sessions. Self-rated stress was measured after each manipulation.

Variables:
  * id (anonymous participant identifier)
  * stress_ctrl (stress in control condition; continuous from 1.00 to 5.00 where higher values indicate more stress)
  * stress_exp (stress in experimental condition; continuous from 1.00 to 5.00 where higher values indicate more stress)
