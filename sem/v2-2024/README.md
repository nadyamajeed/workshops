Files accompanying the SEM workshop for DawnLab in June 2024. All data is artificial.

- path.R with data1.csv
  - 6 observed variables for path analysis
- factor.R with data2.csv
  - 8 observed variables which could load onto 1 latent variable or 2 correlated latent variables
  - For two-dimensional structure, i1-i4 load onto the first factor, and i5-i8 load onto the second factor
- full.R with data3.csv
  - 9 observed variables which load onto 3 latent variables
  - i1-i3 load onto the first factor (predictor), i4-i6 load onto the second factor (mediator), and i7-i9 load onto the third factor (outcome)
  - 3 latent variables for path analysis
