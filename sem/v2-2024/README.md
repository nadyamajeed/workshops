Files accompanying the SEM workshop for DawnLab in June 2024. All data is artificial.

- path.R with data1.csv
  - 6 observed variables for path analysis
- factor.R with data2.csv
  - 8 observed variables which could load onto 1 latent variable or 2 correlated latent variables
  - For two-dimensional structure, i1-i4 load onto the first factor, and i5-i8 load onto the second factor
- full.R with data3.csv
  - 12 observed variables which load onto 4 latent variables
  - i01-i03 load onto the first factor (predictor), i04-i06 load onto the second factor (mediator), and i07-i09 load onto the third factor (outcome 1), and i10-i12 load onto the fourth factor (outcome 2)
  - 4 latent variables for path analysis
